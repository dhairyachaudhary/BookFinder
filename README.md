## Setup 🤓
This project was made using-
* HTML 5
* CSS
* MySQL 8.0
* PHP 8.08
* Apache 2.4.46

This is a pretty simple stack to get the hang of. Since the back-end of the task was mostly database centred I felt this would be good to go for. All tools are easily available and you can also get these bundled together by installing XAMPP.
